### Gameplay

This is a beta version and more will be added to better the UX/UI and overall design. App will be deployed via Heroku.

Users have three guesses to guess the movie and are given some background on what the movie can be. After each guess the user is also given input on how close they are to the answer (yellow = word exists in movie but not in correct, red = word does not exist in the movie, green = word exists in the movie and in correct place). If correct or if all gueses are up, users (and their guesses) are locked out until next week where a new movie will be given.

App uses various CSS animations on the user input fields, and was created with TypeScript with a MERN stack and the 3rd party IMDB API.
